1) My parsing process for the csv file was simply to load each section into the object, eliminating surrounding quotation marks and extraneous double quotations. For the categories, I decided to make a vector which contains all the categories for easier reading during the listInventory command implementation. For any csv value that was blank or just "", I put NA in the text slot.
2) I created test cases for my custom HashTable Insert, Find, and Delete functions. For Insert, I created four cases: inserting at a position within the tablesize, inserting at a value larger than the table size, inserting a duplicate value, and inserting at a negative value. For Find, I created three cases: finding an item at the root of a list, finding an item at a non-root position on the same list, and trying to find a non-existent item. For Delete, I created four cases: deleting an existing item, deleting an item at a non-root position on a linked list, deleting an item that is not present in the table, and deleting the root of the list while confirming that the rest of the list stays intact.
